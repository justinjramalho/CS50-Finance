# CS50 Finance

This repository contains the source code for C$50 Finance, a Flask-based web app for virtual stock trading. Built as part of Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science (Web Track), it simulates managing stock portfolios with real-time quotes from Alpha Vantage.

## üöÄ Project Overview

C$50 Finance allows users to register, log in, look up stock prices, buy/sell shares, track portfolios, and view transaction history. It uses SQLite for persistent storage of users, transactions, and cash balances, with a responsive UI via Jinja2 templates and Bootstrap. The app follows CS50x guidelines for secure password hashing (via werkzeug.security), error handling (e.g., apologies for invalid inputs), and dynamic routing. Designed for educational purposes, it includes accessibility features like alt text for images and keyboard navigation, making it suitable for K-12 demos. Placeholders/mock data can be used for testing API limits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This web app was developed using the following technologies:

* Backend: Python 3, Flask, Jinja2, CS50 SQL library
* Database: SQLite (for users, transactions, portfolios)
* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive navbar and forms)
* APIs: Alpha Vantage (for stock quotes via `lookup()` helper)
* Security: werkzeug.security (for password hashing)
* Version Control: Git & GitHub
* Deployment: PythonAnywhere (free tier for public hosting)

## ‚ú® Key Features

* User Authentication: Register/login with hashed passwords; logout functionality.
* Stock Quote Lookup: Search symbols (e.g., NFLX) and display real-time prices/names via `/quote`.
* Buy/Sell Stocks: Purchase/sell shares at current prices, updating cash and portfolios (validates affordability and ownership).
* Portfolio Tracking: View owned stocks, shares, values, cash balance, and grand total in a table at `/index`.
* Transaction History: Chronological log of buys, sells, and cash deposits at `/history`.
* Add Cash: Personal touch feature to deposit funds via `/add_cash`.
* Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout with centered forms and tables; accessibility via Bootstrap.
* Error Handling: Custom apologies for invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive shares, invalid symbols).
